# red-wine-quality_regression

# Introduction
<br>
The dataset consists of red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine.  The physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available for us to assess the quality metrics of the variant of wine.
<br>
These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are much more normal wines than excellent or poor ones).
<br>
Input variables (based on physicochemical tests): fixed acidity , volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulphur dioxide, total sulphur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol Output variable (based on sensory data): quality (score between 0 and 10)

# Goal 
<br>
## To find a regression model of wine quality with the various physicochemical variables
<br>
Three regression techniques were applied, under a computationally efficient procedure that performs       simultaneous variable and model selection and that is guided by the sensitivity analysis
<br>
<ul>
<li>
The business objective is to support the wine expert evaluations and ultimately improve the quality
<li>
Figure out the significant physiochemical variables that affect the quality of the red wine
<li>
Find out the correlation (positive & negative) between quality of wine & physiochemical variables 
<li>
Obtain predictions from the fitted generalized linear model for most significant physiochemical variables 
</ul>
